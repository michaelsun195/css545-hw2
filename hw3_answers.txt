For the app created for this assignment, each possible state can be described by three simple
variables: uploaded image, text color, and input text. These variables can be modified at will to
demonstrate that the app will always preserve the data of these variables even if the app is closed
or otherwise forcibly terminated.

For our project, the state of the app can be distinguished by which events have reservations made
by the user and the information the user has inputted into the user profile. For example, in the
initial state of our app, the user should not see any events under the list of events they have
RSVP'd for but they should still be able to see a list of nearby events in general under the event
search page; the user profile section should also be empty as the user has not yet inputted that
information. Once a user finishes setting up their profile and RSVP's for two events, those two
events should appear on the home screen under the list of RSVP'd events and the user profile should
contain some basic information about the user, such as name and general interests. These changes in
state are important as we want to ensure that the user does not lose information on RSVP'd events
or previously inputted profile info when the user exits the app, even if the app crashes or is
otherwise forcibly terminated. As a result, whenever the user adds an event or makes any
modification to their profile, a new state is reached and the app will immediately save information
describing the current state using AsyncStorage. This keeps any changes made continuously displayed
and saves that info regardless of whether the user is in the app or not.
