There are three primary methods of storage that we are considering for our app on iOS: the
AsyncStorage API, databases using SQL/SQLite, and cloud storage using a service like Firebase. Each
of these options has distinct pros and cons as noted below.

AsyncStorage
Pros:
- Built in storage API for React Native that has extensive documentation and is extremely compatible
as a result
- Persistent storage that retains stored data while app is not running/updating
Cons:
- Can be slower than other storage options such as SQL/SQLite databases due to the API calls
- Can face storage limits on certain devices
- Can generally only be used to store text data; other APIs should be used for media storage

SQL/SQLite
Pros:
- One of the fastest options for storing and retrieving data
- Easily scalable as storage demands increase
Cons:
- Steeper learning curve to integrate with React Native
- Works best with well-structured data but can struggle otherwise; also more difficult to use
with media storage

Cloud storage (e.g. Firebase)
Pros:
- Frees up local storage when app is not in use
- App data will not be lost if software/hardware issues occur on the device
Cons:
- Can face performance issues due to the multiple API calls required to fetch data each time they
are needed
- Potential privacy concerns with the data being stored in a remote cloud service
- Limited storage available for free
